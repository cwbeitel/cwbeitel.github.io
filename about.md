Hey I'm Christopher. For the last year I've been building infrastructure for machine learning applications in biology with a special interest in the biomedical sciences and predictive wellness. More broadly my key career objective is to contribute to transforming the biomedical sciences through the application of emerging computing and machine learning paradigms. This is my blog.
